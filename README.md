 Heap is a binary tree-based data where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its children.
 Heaps are commonly used to implement a priorities queue where elements are retrieved based on their priority.
 Adding heaps in a heap
Insert node in the available position level.
Compare the inserted node with the parent if it is larger swap it with the parent.
Continue the second step until the order is restored.
Removing items in a list
Replace the element you want to delete with the last element.
Delete the last element
Arrange the node placed at the element deleted to ensure the order of the heap
